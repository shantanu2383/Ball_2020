The code in this repository focuses on the exploration and replication of key findings related to the components of a company's book value of equity: retained earnings and contributed capital. By replicating the existing academic literature, we analyze the predictive power of these components for average returns in U.S. markets.

Here's an overview of our project:

Retained Earnings versus Contributed Capital: We delve into the two distinctive components of the book value of equity. We find that the retained earnings part, which accumulates and averages past earnings, plays a crucial role in predicting the cross-section of average returns. On the other hand, contributed capital doesn't hold any predictive power.

Significance of Retained Earnings: Our analysis shows that retained earnings-to-market, and by extension book-to-market, are strong predictors for returns. This is not because the book value represents the intrinsic value of a firm, but rather because they serve as an effective proxy for the underlying earnings yield.

Book-to-Market Strategies: These findings lead us to further examine and replicate the success of book-to-market strategies. We propose that such strategies work primarily because of the role played by the retained earnings component of the book value.

By revisiting these findings, we aim to contribute to the nuanced understanding of how the components of book value relate to a firm's market performance.
